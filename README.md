📊 Task 01 – Population Distribution Visualization
📌 Objective

The objective of this task is to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. This task demonstrates basic data visualization skills using Python.

📂 Project Overview

In this task, a population dataset representing age-group distribution was used to generate a bar chart visualization. The graph clearly illustrates how the population is distributed across different age groups.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

📈 Visualization

A bar chart was created to represent:

0–20 Years

21–64 Years

65+ Years

The visualization helps compare population size across categories in a clear and interpretable format.

🔍 Key Insight

The analysis shows that the majority of the population falls within the working-age group (21–64 years), followed by younger individuals (0–20 years), while the elderly population (65+ years) represents a smaller percentage.
